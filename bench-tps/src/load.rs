//! Phase 3 — Load generation
//!
//! This module contains the two active components of the load phase:
//!
//! **Generator task** (`run_generator`)
//! A single async task that runs on the tokio runtime.  It reads the current
//! blockhash from `BenchState`, signs a batch of SPL transfer transactions
//! (cycling through `BenchConfig::accounts` and `BenchConfig::destinations`),
//! then pushes the completed batch onto `BatchQueue` and notifies the condvar.
//! It applies backpressure by yielding when the queue is already at
//! `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH` to avoid unbounded memory growth.
//!
//! **Sender threads** (`run_sender_thread`)
//! `--threads` OS threads, each running a blocking loop.  A sender waits on
//! the condvar until a batch is available, pops it, and calls the *synchronous*
//! `solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient::send_transaction` for each transaction
//! in the batch.  Using blocking threads instead of async tasks prevents the
//! RPC calls from monopolising the tokio thread pool and allows straightforward
//! backpressure via the condvar.  After each batch the thread increments
//! `sent_count` (by the number of transactions sent) and sleeps for `sleep_ms`
//! if throttling is enabled.
